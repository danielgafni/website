series of posts is an opinionated tutorial for setting up production-grade Kubernetes clusters &amp; deployments on AWS 1. It aims to be as detailed and correct as possible and will provide complete pieces of relevant source code.\nThis tutorial is split into 2 parts. The first part is devoted to creating EKS &amp; supporting infra, and the second part describes Dagster installation.\n\nIntroduction\nIn the Data &amp; ML space, we often encounter workloads with high computational requirements. Kubernetes with its near to infinite customization options and scalability is a natural choice for running such workloads.\nKubernetes is a platform for running applications in the cloud. We can use it to dynamically provide compute and to configure our deployments.\nWe also need a tool to orchestrate the actual jobs running on the compute resources provided by Kubernetes. Dagster is an excellent Jobs &amp; Data Orchestrator with a unique declarative, asset-based programming model. It’s an ideal choice for batch processing workloads. Dagster can be deployed on Kubernetes, which enables it to orchestrate data processing at massive scale.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nAWS access with sufficient permissions\nA domain (referred to as &lt;domain&gt; in the article) managed by AWS Route 53\n\n\nGoals &amp; Tools\nOn a high level, these are the technical requiremnets for our data processing system:\n\nHave an auto-scaling Dagster deployment running on Kubernetes. Auto-scaling is important because we don’t want to be paying for idle nodes, and we want to spin up a lot of them when processing large amounts of data.\nLeverage cheap Spot instances for up to 90% costs reduction. Spot instances are much cheaper than on-demand instances, but are not reliable and can be shut down at any moment. Workloads using Spot instances should be fault-tolerant, which is usually achieved by techniques such as checkpointing and retries.\nWe need secure external access to this deployment. Because OSS Dagster doesn’t have built-in authentication, we will provide a Basic Auth wrapper for its Webserver. This simple authentication layer can be later replaced by something more flexible (like OAUTH).\nHave automatic Dagster Branch deployments for Pull Requests. Branch Deployments are incredibly useful for development and speedup software iteration cycles by an order of magnitude.\n\nWe will be using various free &amp; Open Source tools in order to satisfy the above requirements 2:\n\nOpenTofu (open Terraform fork) to create the EKS cluster and other supporting infrastructure\nKarpenter for auto-scaling EC2 (spot) instances\nCert Manager for getting free SSL certificates from Let’s Encrypt\nTraefik as a reverse proxy, ingress controller &amp; simple Basic Auth middleware for Dagster’s Webserver\nNodeLocal DNSCache for reducing load on AWS DNS servers (it’s actually quite easy to overload them!)\nArgoCD to deploy Dagster and automatically create Branch Deployments for Pull Requests\n\n\nWho scales the autoscaler?\nFor all things AWS, we will be using the amazing terraform-aws-modules Terraform modules. They provide pre-configured AWS resources for common use-cases.\nLet’s start by creating the EKS cluster:\n\nClick to reveal code\n\n\n\nThe terraform code creates a local variable local.cluster_subdomain. We compose it as following: k8s-&lt;region&gt;-&lt;cluster-name&gt;. This is a human-readable sensible default as cluster names are unique per region. We will be assigning k8s-&lt;region&gt;-&lt;cluster-name&gt;.&lt;domain&gt; to Traefik’s LoadBalancer later on.\nNotice how the cluster only has a single Node Group. This is because we are going to be using Karpenter for node provisioning.\n\nCreating NodePools with Karpenter\nKarpenter is a feature-rich and easy to use Kubernetes autoscaler. It allows defining NodePools and other objects as Kubernetes Custom Resources via simple YAML. This is beneficial for multiple reasons, and allows doing really interesting (and questionable) stuff like configuring NodePools from application helm values.\nWhile being really great, Karpenter pods can’t magically appear in our cluster out of nowhere, so sadly they need an initial NodeGroup to run on. Afterwards, Karpenter will launch additional EC2 instances to join the cluster to satisfy Pod scheduling needs.\nCurrently, Karpenter only works with AWS EKS, but the project is aiming to support other cloud providers in the future.\nKarpenter is aware of Kubernetes well-known labels (such as OS, CPU architecture, …) and aws-specific labels (such as instance-type, instance-size, …) is aware of instance pricing, can drain Kubernetes nodes running on spot instances ahead of node termination, and much more. This enables configuring really flexible auto-scaling NodePools.\nLet’s install Karpenter to our cluster and add a default NodePool. We will be using the community kubectl Terraform provider to create Karpenter’s Custom Resources (CRs), since the other official provider - kubernetes - does not properly support CRs, so we are left with whatever actually works.\n\nClick to reveal code\n\n\n\nThis is how we can add a NodePool for spot instances:\n\nif the requirement karpenter.sh/capacity-type is set to math both \"on-demand\" and \"spot\", then Karpenter will prefer spot instances and automatically fallback to on-demand during shortages.\n\nGPU nodes\nIf you are doing machine learning, chances are you will need GPUs in your cluster!\nHere is how we can setup a GPU-compatible EC2NodeClass with Karpenter:\n\nClick to reveal code\n\n\n\nYou can explore EKS AMI releases for more images.\nNow, let’s reference this EC2NodeClass to create a NodePool:\n\nThe requirements field here is really versatile and can be changed according to specific needs.\n\nDNS caching\nThe last component to complete the hyper scaling setup is NodeLocal DNS Cache. It’s really important to set it up, otherwise launching more than ~500 pods will result in frequent Temporary Name Resolution Failure when accessing AWS services such as S3 or RDS.\n\n\nI haven’t included supporting Terraforms files (providers.tf, variables.tf and outputs.tf) above since they are self-explanatory.\nNow, let’s get to the ingress LoadBalancer setup.\n\nCloud District\nWe are aiming to expose (securely) our Kubernetes services to the outside world, and we are not running away from Load Balancers, various middlewares, autentication, route management, SSL certificates, and so on. Setting all of this in automated fasion for Branch Deployments might get really complicated.\nTraefik and Cert Manager are the two mainstream free and open source Kubernetes applications  often used to solve this kind of problems. I will give a brief explanation below, but the reader is welcome to dive into their documentation.\nTraefik is a reverse proxy which can be deployed with it’s own Load Balancer. It can then route traffic from this Load Balancer to other Kubernetes services. It can be used to inject various useful middlewares which can do stuff like https -&gt; http redirect, rate limiting, basic auth, modify request paths, etc. The full list can be found here. It also allows to automatically provision SSL certificates and supports free services such as Lets Encrypt. It allows doing all of this via Kubernetes CRs. Load Balancers can get quite expensive, and Traefik allows easily using a single Load Balancer for all your services. It also has a great dashboard!\nWhile Traefik can generate SSL certificates out of the box, we will be using a separate solution for that - Cert Manager. This way we are not too reliant on Traefik, and Cert Manager is actually more versatile (since issuing certificates is it’s primary job).\nBoth Traefik and Cert Manager can be deployed without Terraform, but using Terraform allows automating the registration of the CNAME record for Traefik’s Load Balancer, which is a crusial step when provisioning new EKS clusters.\nSeems like a match made in the cloud heaven!\nLet’s start by installing Traefik.\n\nClick to reveal code\n\n\n\nWe installed the Traefik helm chart into traefik namespace. We annotated the Service with service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-type: nlb to create an AWS external LoadBalancer, and created CNAME DNS records in AWS Route 53 to route web requests to our domain to this LoadBalancer.\nNotice how the chart has the default dashboard’s IngressRoute disabled. Instead, we are going to create a custom one. We are going to need an SSL certificate to secure the dashboard with HTTPS. Let’s install Cert Manager to issue this certificate:\n\nClick to reveal code\n\n\n\nWe installed the cert-manager Helm chart into cert-manage namespace and created a ClusterIssuer for the DNS-01 challange. This challenge requires creating a given TXT record for the claimed domain, so cert-manager’s pod will need access to certain Route 53 policies in order to create this record on Let’s Enctrypt’s demand. This is covered by creating an IAM role for cert-manager and providing the role’s name as Kubernetes Service Account annotation.\nNow, we can continue with Traefik Dashboard setup:\n\nClick to reveal code\n\n\n\nFirst, we create a Certificate - a CR provided by Cert Manager - claiming to own the domain traefik.${local.cluster_subdomain}.${var.domain}. Once the Certificate CR is created in Kubernetes, Cert Manager’s Controller pod will notice it and start the domain verification process agsinst Let’s Encrypt by using the DNS-01 challenge. Let’s Encrypt will give Cert Manager a secret token and ask it to expose it via a TXT DNS record. Cert Manager will create this AWS Route 53 record, thus proving actual domain ownership to Let’s Encrypt, and the Certificate will be issued and stored in a corresponding Kubernetes Secret. Note that Cert Manager supports multiple other DNS providers other than Route 53.\nWe then reference this Secret in the IngresRoute - a CR provided by Traefik. We also create and reference a bunch of supporting resources, such as Basic Auth middleware, and store the password for it in AWS Secrets Manager.\nPhew! After running tofu apply, a bit of patience (and possible tears if something goes wrong), we should be able to:\n\ninspect the created AWS Secrets Manager secret for Traefik Dashboard to retrive the Traefik Dashboard password\naccess the Traefik Dashboard at https://traefik.k8s-&lt;region&gt;-&lt;cluster&gt;.&lt;domain&gt;/dashboard/ (the training slash is important)\n\nThe dashboard allows inspecting the created routes for more details:\n\n\nWrapping it up\nIn this first part of our tutorial, we have laid a solid foundation by setting up a production-ready EKS cluster on AWS. We have configured essential components such as Karpenter for auto-scaling, NodeLocal DNS Cache for reliable DNS resolution, and Traefik with Cert Manager for secure external access. This setup ensures that our infrastructure is both scalable and secure, ready to handle high computational workloads typical in Data and ML applications.\n\nIn the next chapter, we will delve into the installation and configuration of ArgoCD, a powerful GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. ArgoCD will enable us to manage our Kubernetes applications declaratively, ensuring consistent and automated deployment workflows, specifically for Branch Deployments. We will then use ArgoCD to deploy Dagster.\n\n\nFootnotes\n1\nWhile this tutorial is tailored for AWS, only Karpenter from all the used tools is AWS-specific. However, Karpeneter is aiming to support other clouds in the future.\n\n2\nThe only required proprietary component is AWS EKS itselt.\n\n","id":"https://danielgafni.github.io/website/pr-preview/pr-28/blog/cloud-computing-eks-part-1/","title":"Cloud Computing with EKS: Cluster Setup"},"https://danielgafni.github.io/website/pr-preview/pr-28/blog/cloud-computing-eks-part-2/":{"body":"In the previous part of this series, we learned how to prepare a EKS cluster for some cloud computing. Now, we are going to learn how to setup Production and Preview environments (also called Branch Deployments) to organize and streamline development of data pipelines powered by Dagster.\n\nWhat are Branch Deployments?\nOne of the companies I worked at called them Feature Stages. GitLab calls them Preview Apps. In Dagster, they are known as Branch Deployments.\nRegardless of naming, the meaning of this powerful concept is the same - deploying a development version of an application to a separate environment created specifically for the git branch or Pull Request.\nThis DevOps methodology allows testing the entire application in an environment similar to production before merging the code to the main branch. It’s extremely useful when fully automated and done right, because developers get to effortlessly test their apps without intefeiring each other and pinging Infrastructure teams.\nIn contrast to using, Branch Deployments traditionally require quite some work to be set up. For this reason, they are provided as Dagster+ feature.\n\nAnd why do I need to care about ArgoCD?\nArgoCD is quite an amazing piece of technology. It can easily pull off tricks which traditional CD systems will struggle to implement. Branch Deployments is one of them.\nArgoCD has a concept of ApplicationSet - a template which can spawn multiple instances of Applicationss. ApplicationSets can be backed by various Generators, pullRequest being one of them.\nThe pullRequest Generator creates a new copy of an Application for currently opened Pull Requests and allows injecting information like branch name, PR ID, and commit hash into the Application manifest. ArgoCD will then take care of deploying the Application into the Kubernetes cluster.\n","id":"https://danielgafni.github.io/website/pr-preview/pr-28/blog/cloud-computing-eks-part-2/","title":"Cloud Computing with EKS: Dagster with ArgoCD"},"https://danielgafni.github.io/website/pr-preview/pr-28/blog/cracking-the-python-monorepo/":{"body":"A monorepo is a single repository that contains multiple projects. It is a popular way to organize codebases with many coupled components, and is also used at very big companies like Google, Facebook, and Twitter.\nFor a long time, I did not understand the benefits of monorepos. I thought they were used because people could not figure out how to split their codebases into smaller parts.\nAfter working at Dagster (on a pretty huge monorepo with more than 140k lines of code and 70+ subprojects), I realized that monorepos can provide quite a pleasant development experience when done right — with the right tooling, practices, and, of course, the right use case. Monorepos solve a very specific problem: local dependencies between projects force them to be updated together, which eliminates certain types of technical debt (e.g. ensures all current projects are always compatible with each other). I also anjoyed using all this tooling which somebody else has built for me (but I imagine it’s not as fun to build it).\nIt’s worth noting that monorepos are not a silver bullet. They have their own set of challenges, mostly the need to build custom tooling and to organize the development workflow. The big tech companies have the resources to build and maintain these tools, but for smaller companies, it can be quite challenging.\nDagster’s monorepo wasn’t perfect either. Some of the drawbacks were:\n\nSlow CI/CD pipelines: builds could run for hours!\nLegacy Python packaging made maintaining dependencies and CI pipelines quite complicated. Making a change to dependencies required editing multiple configuration files at a few locations with great care.\n\nThese problems were mostly due to technical debt\n\n    I started migrating Dagster’s monorepo to uv but at the time got blocked by  conflicting development dependencies for different test suites, which was not supported by uv at that time (but is now).\n\n\nThis post focuses on a very specific use case — uv Python monorepos. Until very recently, Python monorepos were quite hard to set up and maintain, with problems like the ones I mentioned above being quite common.\nHowever, nowadays we have a bunch of excellent tooling available with great out-of-the-box monorepo support.\n\n    \n    \n        WARNING\n        uv shouldn’t need any introduction. In 2024, uv took the Python ecosystem by storm, and it’s now the go-to tool for Python development. Using anything else (except perhaps Pixi which builds on top of uv and extends it to handle Conda packages) doesn’t make much sense anymore. If you haven’t heard about uv, that’s a sure sign you’ve been living in a cave—or otherwise off the grid—for the past year.\n\n    \n\n\nThe dream of the monorepo\nIn this post, I am going to share an approach to building Python monorepos that solves these issues in a very elegant way. The benefits of this approach are:\n\nit works with any uv project (even yours!)\nit needs little to zero maintenance and boilerplate\nit provides end-to-end pipeline caching — including steps downstream to building the image (like running linters and tests), which is quite rare\nit’s easy to run locally and in CI\n\nWe will walk through a typical monorepo setup and use uv and Dagger to build lightning-fast and modular build pipelines. Feel free to check out the docs for these tools (uv quickstart, Dagger quickstart). Impatient readers can jump straight to the Dagger module.\n\nPython packaging: 🐍 📦 😱\nPlease look at the emojis above until you get it. Yes, managing packaging in a Python monorepo can be a nightmare. But it doesn’t have to be!\nAnd it’s really not with the right tooling.\n\nuv has the concept of workspaces which allows installing individual packages from a monorepo and makes managing dependencies a breeze. It standardizes dependency management and maintenance operations in monorepos, including operations with local dependencies.\nDagger — a universal build tool which supports multiple languages (including Python) to define containerized build pipelines. Because Dagger pipelines can be written in Python, they can be easily adapted to work with monorepos of arbitrary complexity and structure. Dagger is essentially a glorified Dockerfile generator available in your favorite programming language. Dagger pipelines are huge graphs of BuildKit (the engine used by Docker when building images) steps, so the entire pipeline can be optimized, parallelized, and cached by BuildKit.\nmodern QA tooling: ruff and pyright have first-class support for monorepos and are able to automatically discover and merge configuration files from multiple subdirectories.\n\n\nA brief history of Python packaging\nContrary to what you might think, Python packaging is not a nightmare anymore. It used to be, but with the introduction of PEP 517 and PEP 518, and the rise of uv, it’s actually in pretty good shape — I rarely have to pull out my hair when working with Python packaging nowadays.\n\n    I remember sweating hard before running poetry lock which I knew would run for an hour or two with my shitty internet connection because these juicy PyTorch wheels just had to be downloaded and hashed for every combination of Python and OS. Good times!\n\n\nThe PEPs and their adoption were important to standardize the way Python packages are built and distributed. Because the overwhelming majority of Python packages now provide correct distribution metadata (like hashes of the package contents), it’s much easier for advanced and optimized package managers like uv to do their job really well. Some machine learning dependencies — and specifically PyTorch — used to sabotage the Python packaging ecosystem, but even PyTorch now (mostly) provides the hashes with the various wheels they build for all these CUDA versions.\nTherefore, I’d like to note that the improvements with packaging are not only due to better tooling like uv, but also due to the community’s effort to standardize and improve the Python packaging ecosystem in general.\n\nSetting up the monorepo\nFair enough! Let’s start by invoking uv (assuming the dear reader has — and he should — uv installed) and creating a new workspace:\n\nPhew! That was a lot of commands. Let’s break them down:\n\nuv init initializes a project. A workspace is a directory that contains one or more packages. It’s a way to group packages together and manage their dependencies, while allowing cross-package dependencies.\nuv add --group dev adds dependencies to the root project. Development groups are only used when working on the project and are not registered as dependencies when the project is published. Downstream projects will not inherit these dependencies.\nuv init --package --lib projects/lib-one initializes a new package in the projects directory. The --lib flag tells uv that this package is a library. This is important because it will add a [build-system] section to the pyproject.toml file, which is required for uv to know how to build the package.\nuv lock creates a uv.lock file that contains the resolved dependencies for the workspace. This file is used by uv to determine which versions of the dependencies to install.\n\nAfter this section, you should see something like this (non-essential files are omitted):\n\nProjects recognized by uv as workspace members share the same uv.lock file, environment, can be added as dependencies to each other, and can be managed with uv commands.\n\n    \n    \n        TIP\n        I like to edit the root pyproject.toml and set workspace.members to ['projects/*'] so that all the packages in the projects directory are recognized as workspace members.\n\n    \n\nTo demonstrate how one project can be added as a dependency to another, let’s add lib-one as a dependency to lib-two:\n\nThe --package flag tells uv to execute the command in the context of the lib-two package. The lib-one package is added as a dependency to lib-two’s pyproject.toml and the root uv.lock file is updated automatically.\nYou can see it now? There is more than one package in our repository, therefore, it’s a monorepo! 🎉\n\nCache me if you can\nWho knows how to write a Dockerfile? I’m sure you do. Do you know how to write it efficiently? Are you sure? In any case, we are about to unleash the combined power of Dagger (backed by BuildKit), and uv, to build our monorepo in a very (very) efficient way.\nWe don’t actually need a Dockerfile. We could have used Dagger to define the entire build process in Python. However, since it might complicate building the project with plain docker or other tools, we are still going to define most of the build with a traditional Dockerfile. But:\n\nWe will define an intermediate stage almost identical to the final stage.\nWe will then call Dagger to build the project in the intermediate stage. We will then complete the final stage programmatically with Dagger.\n\nThis approach allows building a very similar image locally just with docker build . if needed.\nFor simplicity, all the subprojects will share the same Dockerfile. Behold!\n\nClick to reveal the Dockerfile\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        NOTE\n        The resulting image will contain a subset of the monorepo dependencies needed for the specific project due to the --package flag.\n\n    \n\nThat’s a lot of Docker magic! Let’s break it down:\n\nThe deps-prod stage installs only runtime dependencies. This is useful for building a more lightweight image for deployment.\nThe deps-dev stage installs development dependencies. This is useful for building an image for QA checks or running tests.\nThe final stage installs the package itself. Only at this point the source code is copied into the image. The last uv sync invocation doesn’t install any third-party dependencies, only the dependencies from our monorepo (uv workspace). Noticed the --no-install-workspace flag spammed all over the place? It’s quite important as it configures uv sync to ignore the missing source code and install only the dependencies.\n\n\n    \n    \n        INFO\n        The --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/uv flag tells Docker to mount the cache directory to the build container. This way, the cache is persisted between builds and doesn’t inflate the image itself.\n\n    \n\nWhat a great Dockerfile! It’s so efficient that it’s almost a crime. Or is it not? Can you spot the problem?\nLet’s have a hypothetical conversation between you (the dear reader) and a Docker guru:\n– You: Hey, I know! Just look at that filthy COPY . . before the final uv sync! It will invalidate the cache every time any file in the monorepo changes!\n– Docker guru: You are right! But how can we fix it?\n– You: Oh, I’m very smart. Let’s only copy our package’s source code into the image and then uv sync it. Check this out!\n\n– Docker guru: Wow! You are a genius! But what if our package depends on some other package in the monorepo?\n– You: Oh, that’s easy! We can just add another COPY instruction for the dependency before running uv sync.\n– Docker guru: Oh and what if we have multiple packages that depend on each other? Are you going to write a new COPY instruction for each of them? Are you going to maintain a separate Dockerfile for each set of dependencies? What if they are scattered around the repo instead of being carefully placed in projects/ and hard to track? By the way, COPY . . is cursed in another way. It will always invalidate the final image cache and trigger potentially expensive downstream steps in your CI pipeline like running tests. A pipeline like this is doomed to be slow.\nWith plain Docker, we are left with two options:\n\nCarefully (probably manually) track all inter-package dependencies and maintain COPY instructions in multiple Dockerfiles.\nSlap a COPY . . and accept the fact that the final image will always be rebuilt from scratch.\n\nPick your poison.\n\nRemember our goal: to avoid unnecessary rebuilds of the final image and granularly include only the source code of the packages that are actually needed. What if we could programmatically define the Dockerfile? What if we could define the build process in Python? What if there is already a place in our project where the local dependencies graph is defined precisely?\nThink about it for a moment. I will give you a hint: it’s \n\n\n\n    \n    \n        the uv.lock file.\n\n    \n\n I’m sorry this wasn’t a hint but a direct answer, but let’s move on.\n\nA thousand daggers\nLet’s look into the uv.lock file for a moment. It’s a TOML file that describes the entire dependency tree of our monorepo. At the very top, you will find:\n\n🎉 🎉 🎉 🎉 🎉 🎉 🎉 🎉 🎉 🎉 🎉 🎉 🎉 🎉 🎉 🎉 🎉 🎉 🎉 🎉 🎉 🎉 🎉 🎉 🎉 🎉 🎉 🎉 🎉 🎉 🎉 🎉\nAt the beginning of the uv.lock file is the members array. It contains a list of all the workspace members (our local packages), including the root member uv-dagger-dream.\nNext comes the package array. Each element in the package array describes a package (local or third-party) in the monorepo. Notice the source key in the package table. It points to the source code of the package. And we can use it to identify the local dependencies of a given package.\nThe plan:\n\nbuild the original Dockerfile up to the deps-dev stage. At this point, we have all the production dependencies installed, but the source code is not copied and installed yet.\nextract the information about the local dependencies from the uv.lock file (with Python)\nuse it to copy the source code of each local dependency into the image\nthen we can run uv sync to install the local dependencies (including our project) in editable mode\n\nDocker can’t cover steps 2, and 3. But Dagger can! Let’s write a Dagger function to do this.\n\n    \n    \n        NOTE\n        The words container and image are used interchangeably in this post. Technically, a container is a running instance of an image, but Dagger defines the Container type, so I will use the word container to refer to images most of the time.\n\n    \n\nWe will start by creating a new Dagger module sitting in a separate package in our monorepo. This way we keep it independent and reusable.\n\nThis command will create a new Dagger module in the .dagger directory.\n\nA work-around for Dagger not supporting uv workspaces\n\nThe Dagger package we just added is not configured to be a workspace member because of this current limitation of Dagger (this may already be fixed at the time of reading). It also relies on an ephemeral local sdk package which is excluded from version control and may not be always available for uv.\nHere are the steps for a workaround at the time of writing:\n\nRemove the following from .dagger/pyproject.toml:\n\n\nand run uv add tomli (we will use it to read uv.lock) inside the .dagger directory.\nThis will ensure that the Dagger module is not dependent on the local sdk package and will fetch dagger-io from PyPI instead.\n\nAdd the Dagger module as a development dependency to the root project:\n\n\nThis will enable type checking and linting for our Dagger module.\n\nMove dagger.json to the repo root, and add\n\n\nto it.\n\nFinally, add\n\n\nto the root pyproject.toml.\n\n\nNow we can run the dagger call command from the repo root.\n\nBuilding the build pipeline\nWe will go backwards because it’s somewhat easier to understand in my opinion. Feel free to consult the Dagger Python SDK documentation.\nFirst, we will do a bunch of imports and define some useful types:\n\n\n\nAnd here is the Dagger entry point — MonorepoDagger, also called a Dagger Module. The method build_project defines a Dagger Function which will be available as\n\nfrom the command line. The build_project function will build the Docker image for a given project and will only contain the dependencies and source code required for that project. This function will call other high-level methods of the class to achieve this.\n\nThe debug_sleep argument will be useful later.\n\nLet’s implement the container_with_third_party_dependencies method first. That’s easy, we just need to use the existing Dockerfile and specify the deps-dev target stage. Note how we don’t need any files except pyproject.toml and uv.lock to build the Docker image for a given project. This is possible thanks to uv workspaces.\n\n\n    \n    \n        NOTE\n        We also create a dummy README.md file because Hatch — the default build system in uv projects — requires it to be present.\n\n    \n\n\nThe project_sources_map dictionary is the precious information we need to enable granular copying of the source code. Here is the implementation of the get_project_sources_map method which retrieves it:\n\nThis function will parse the uv.lock file and return a dictionary where the keys are the project names and the values are the paths to the source code.\n\n    \n    \n        INFO\n        Most of the Dagger operations are lazy. The operations which trigger materializations are async and therefore must be explicitly awaited. This is why we use await to fetch the uv.lock file contents. It’s a very elegant way to express blocking operations, because once part of the code becomes async (blocking), all the code that calls it must also be async (blocking). Smart!\n\n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        NOTE\n        For extra cache efficiency this can be replaced by creating empty directories and files and delaying the source code copying to after the last uv sync command, but we will keep it simple for the sake of this blog post. Also, the current approach is already good enough.\n\n    \n\n\nOur source code is still not copied into the image. Let’s implement the copy_source_code method which will granularly copy the source code of a given project and its dependencies into the image. This is why we are here!\n\n\nNow the only thing left is to install the local dependencies in editable mode:\n\n\nAll together:\n\nClick to reveal the full Dagger module\n\n\n\nThe beauty of this approach is that we can now take full advantage of:\n\nuv’s project discovery\nthe fact that uv workspace configuration is standardized and well-defined\nand always kept in sync with the actual project structure when running uv commands\n\nWe can build the Docker image for any project in the monorepo with a single command:\n\nWe can add a project to an arbitrary location in the monorepo, add other projects as dependencies, and build the new project without changing anything:\n\nRunning dagger call build-project --root-dir . --project lib-three just works despite the weird location of the lib-three project and zero build pipeline changes!\n\nProof\n\n\nNow let’s confirm caching works as expected. lib-one doesn’t depend on lib-two, so modifying files in lib-two should not invalidate the cache for lib-one. Because Dagger doesn’t always log the intermediate hash digests, we will use the --debug-sleep flag to check whether the build stage is skipped.\nThe first build:\n\nNow let’s change something in lib-two and rebuild lib-one:\n\nHooray! The build only took 2.6s now — the cache has not been invalidated and the build stage has been skipped!\n\n    \n    \n        INFO\n        The build is not fully cached because the --root-dir argument points at the entire repo (which did change). But it doesn’t matter because the final image is cached and the build stage is skipped.\n\n    \n\n\nGrowing the pipeline\nNow that we have a Dagger Function which builds a container for a given project, we can easily create downstream steps in our CI pipeline. For example, this is how we can run tests for a project after building the container:\n\nRunning the tests becomes:\n\nNote how we can do it in one function call. Any upstream steps (like building the image) are automatically executed before the tests and are very likely to be cached.\nAnother one with pyright:\n\nNow we can just call these Dagger functions locally or in our CI/CD system (typically one CI/CD step corresponds to one dagger call) — they will work exactly the same! Dagger Cloud can also be used to execute builds remotely (and the entire team can benefit from the shared cache). It’s also worth mentioning their integration with Depot — provider for accelerated builds and caching, which requires zero configuration and can speed up builds even more.\n\nConclusion\nWhen combined together, uv and Dagger provide powerful features that dramatically simplify build processes in Python monorepos, while maintaining flexibility and providing enormous performance gains.\nThe pipeline we built is a good starting point for further customization and optimization. You can add more steps to the pipeline, such as linting, code formatting, and deployment steps, and add configuration options to create a comprehensive build process that meets your specific requirements. It’s very easy because it’s just Python code. You could even generalize this approach to work with multiple uv workspaces (so multiple uv.lock files) in a single monorepo.\nI encourage you to explore the documentation for these tools to fully understand their capabilities and how they can be tailored to your specific needs.\n\nReferences and Acknowledgements\n\nsource code for this blog post\nuv docs\nDagger docs\n\n\nThank you @nordmtr for the feedback and suggestions!\n","id":"https://danielgafni.github.io/website/pr-preview/pr-28/blog/cracking-the-python-monorepo/","title":"Cracking the Python Monorepo"},"https://danielgafni.github.io/website/pr-preview/pr-28/blog/custom-dagster-asset-decorator/":{"body":"This article is showcasing a surprising way of utilizing functools.wraps for building highly customizable and versatile Asset Factories in Dagster.

Instead of that, normal yaml or toml files are used.\nAfter trying them out I immediately decided there was no going back.\nIn this post I will not describe the installation or configuration of these tools (you can always read the docs), but rather highlight the key features and explain the benefits over the traditional tools.\n\nNushell\nNushell, or nu, is a modern data-oriented shell written in Rust. It requires almost zero configuration to start working with it, even though a lot can be configured, has syntax highlighting, auto-completion and other useful features enabled by default. It implements all shell commands (like ls, cat, etc), but in a very special way - they are now aware of their inputs and outputs content. Lets take a look at this examples.\nList files in the current directory:\n\nFilter by file size:\n\nAnd sort by modified timestamp:\n\nAs we can see, nu stores the data representation (in this case the ls command output) as a table, while bash/zsh ls outputs simple text. In fact, the way these tables are rendered can seem familiar to some of you… yes, nu is using polars.DataFrame internally!\nThe same can be applied to any file, even with nested structure (not showing the full output here):\n\nAnd now access a field:\n\nThis is extremely useful when working with yaml , toml , json , csv and other structured files. No need to use grep, jq or enter vim !\nAnother positive side of nu is it’s error handling.\n\nThe shell is clearly pointing us at the error source.\n\nNu DataFrames: a bonus for a Data Scientist\nBecause nu is using polars internally, it has first class support for tabular operations, and it is possible to perform them from the shell directly! Of course, this outperforms pandas by orders of magnitude. A lot of complex operations on data can be performed without opening Jupyter at all.\nBy the way, nushell is officially supported by Poetry since 1.2.0.\n\nStarship\nStarship is a terminal prompt written in .. yes, in \n\n\n\n    \n    \n        Rust\n\n    \n\n\n. It makes in very fast (actually, this is not an improvement over powerlevel10k since it’s written in C++). Starship has very rich configuration options in a simple yaml file. But, just like nushell , it doesn’t need any configuration initially - all the defaults are already set! It also provides nice ready-to-use config presets.\nStarship automatically integrates with multiple other tools &amp; technologies. It can display package versions (for example, when in a Poetry project), show AWS region, kubernetes context &amp; namespace.. in short, it works with everything. Take a look at the full list of integrations here.\nOf course, it also looks good. Here is the default prompt with no configuration:\n\n\nZellij\nZellij is a terminal multiplexer written in Python. Kidding, it’s actually written in R…. Rust. It’s very similar to tmux, and even supports tmux commands, but has some user-friendly advantages:\n\nOperation modes: pane, tab, resize, etc…\nThe panes are mouse-scrollable and mouse-clickable\nLayouts can be saved to simple yaml files. For example, a layout can be saved for every project you are working on.\n\n\nFor every operational mode there are very limited possible actions. Thanks to that, a help bar is displayed showing the current available commands.\ndefault mode\n\ntab mode\n\npane mode\n\nThe modes can be easily switched with: ctrl+p = pane, ctrl+t = tab, etc. It’s really a blessing for a newcomer. You don’t need to read tutorials or search how to do “this thing I really need right now” in zellij. The help bar ensures you are never lost. The bar can be hidden after you learn zellij, the bar can be hidden.\nThanks to the limited available actions per mode, the navigation through zellij is greatly simplified.\nAgain, you don’t need to configure anything at all to achieve this! In contrary,tmux needs a dozen of plugins. Of course, zellij supports plugins too.\n\nBonus: other awesome CLI tools\nWezterm\nWezterm is a terminal emulator written in Rust. I’m currently exploring it in favor of Alacritty because the latter does not support ligatures. It can also act as terminal multiplexer and supports tabs for ssh-sessions.\nbat\nbat is cat with syntax highlighting:\n\nsheldon\nsheldon is a shell plugin manager that currently works with bashand zsh. It has a nice CLI interface, stores the config in a readable .toml file, and is pretty fast.\nbtop\nbtopis a resources monitoring tool like htop , but with a richer and more intuitive UI and controls. Sadly, it’s not written in rust, but I decided to included it here anyway. For a Rust alternative, you can check out bottom, however, it’s less mature.\n\nClosing Notes\n\n    \n    \n        TIP\n        You can find more awesome Rust CLI tools in this Reddit post.\n\n    \n\nMy old and new (warning: nix!) dotfiles repos include some config files which can be used for inspiration.\nFinally, subscribe to my Telegram channel for more dev &amp; ML content.\n\n1\n[2024] An excellent modern plugin manager would be sheldon\n\n2\n[2024] At the time of writing there were no nushell plugins. Currently nushell has a plugin system, some plugins can be found here.\n\n","id":"https://danielgafni.github.io/website/pr-preview/pr-28/blog/modern-cli-stack/","title":"The Modern CLI Stack"},"https://danielgafni.github.io/website/pr-preview/pr-28/pages/":{"body":"","id":"https://danielgafni.github.io/website/pr-preview/pr-28/pages/","title":""},"https://danielgafni.github.io/website/pr-preview/pr-28/projects/":{"body":"Projects I’ve built professionally\n","id":"https://danielgafni.github.io/website/pr-preview/pr-28/projects/","title":"Projects"},"https://danielgafni.github.io/website/pr-preview/pr-28/projects/cardiospike/":{"body":"RardioSpike was an ML competition in heart anomalies prediction.
