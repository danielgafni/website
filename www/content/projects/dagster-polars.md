`dagster-polars` allows loading and saving `polars` DataFrames from Dagster's `@asset`s and `@op`s. It supports multiple serialization formats and storage systems. 

It started as my [standalone](https://github.com/danielgafni/dagster-polars) project, but eventually got merged into the main Dagster [repository](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/tree/master/python_modules/libraries/dagster-polars).
