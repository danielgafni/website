I'm an ML/MLOps engineer, professional big data wrangler, Linux enthusiast, OSS believer and contributor, and a corgi owner.

My areas of interest are Deep Learning, production ML systems, distributed (Big Data) workloads, Kubernetes, good Python code, and I'm pretty active in the Dagster community.

I have a Telegram [channel](https://t.me/nadya_nafig) with random tech stuff.
